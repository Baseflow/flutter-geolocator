# Flutter geolocator plugin

The Flutter geolocator plugin is build following the federated plugin architecture. A detailed explanation of the federated plugin concept can be found in the [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#federated-plugins). This means the geolocator plugin is separated into the following packages:

1. [`geolocator`][1]: the app facing package. This is the package users depend on to use the plugin in their project. For details on how to use the [`geolocator`][1] plugin you can refer to its [README.md][2] file.
2. [`geolocator_android`][3]: this package contains the endorsed Android implementation of the geolocator_platform_interface and adds Android support to the [`geolocator`][1] app facing package. More information can be found in its [README.md][4] file;
2. [`geolocator_apple`][5]: this package contains the endorsed iOS and macOS implementations of the geolocator_platform_interface and adds iOS and macOS support to the [`geolocator`][1] app facing package. More information can be found in its [README.md][6] file;
2. [`geolocator_web`][7]: this package contains the endorsed web implementation of the geolocator_platform_interface and adds web support to the [`geolocator`][1] app facing package. More information can be found in its [README.md][8] file;
2. [`geolocator_windows`][9]: this package contains the endorsed Windows implementation of the geolocator_platform_interface and adds Windows support to the [`geolocator`][1] app facing package. More information can be found in its [README.md][10] file;
