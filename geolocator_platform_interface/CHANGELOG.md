## 2.1.1

## 1.0.7

- Solves a bug causing less accurate location fixes (see [#531](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-geolocator/issues/531)).

## 1.0.6+1

- Solve a bug which adds a zero timeout when no timeout is supplied (see [#564]((https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-geolocator/issues/564))).

## 1.0.6

- Allow developers to call the `getCurrentPosition` method while already listening to a position stream (see issue [#546](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-geolocator/issues/546));
